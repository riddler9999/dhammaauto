SCENE LIBRARY BY EMOTIONAL THEME:

- Peace/ငြိမ်းချမ်း: Slow dolly forward through Bagan temple field at sunrise, golden light washing over thousands of pagodas, morning mist rising gently, birds flying across frame
- Wealth/စည်းစိမ်: Shwedagon Pagoda time-lapse from dusk to night, gold surface catching last sunlight then transitioning to illuminated glow, devotees with candles in foreground
- Suffering/ဒုက္ခ: Single ancient crumbling Bagan temple in rain, water droplets on weathered stone, grey sky, slow zoom out revealing vastness and solitude
- Protection/အကာအကွယ်: Slow orbit around large golden Buddha statue in temple interior, warm candlelight flickering, incense smoke drifting upward, peaceful atmosphere
- Urgency/သံဝေဂ: Sunrise breaking through narrow window of dark temple interior, single beam of golden light moving across ancient stone floor, dust particles floating in light
- Generosity/ဒါန: Monastery morning alms round, golden light, monks walking slowly in line with alms bowls, devotees offering food, warm atmosphere
- Wisdom/ပညာ: Interior of Ananda Temple Bagan, camera slowly tilting up from floor to reveal massive standing Buddha, light entering from above

CAMERA MOTION (critical for AI video):
- Always specify ONE smooth camera motion
- Preferred: slow dolly, gentle orbit, smooth tilt up, gradual zoom out
- NEVER: handheld, fast motion, cuts, multiple angles

MYANMAR ARCHITECTURAL ACCURACY:
- Mandalay Buddha: pointed flame finial, elongated earlobes, downcast serene eyes
- Shwedagon: bell-shaped stupa, octagonal base, gold surface
- Bagan: flat plain, thousands of temples, specific styles per temple
- NEVER: Thai, Tibetan, Chinese, Japanese architectural styles

TECHNICAL:
- "Cinematic 4K footage" as style anchor
- Warm golden color grading
- Shallow depth of field where appropriate
- 5-10 second continuous shot
- No text, no people's faces, no modern elements

OUTPUT: Single paragraph prompt. No formatting. No explanations.
